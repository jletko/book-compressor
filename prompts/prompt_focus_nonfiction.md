*   **Thematic Focus**: Prioritize concepts, known examples, and arguments related to: **{theme_list}**.
    *   **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: Use the literal words '{theme_list}' SPARINGLY - only when absolutely necessary. These are thematic keywords, not words to repeat.
    *   Focus on the *relationships*, *implications*, *examples*, and *supporting evidence* that connect to these themes WITHOUT constantly naming them.
    *   Reserve word budget for these thematically-relevant topics.
