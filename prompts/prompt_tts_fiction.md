**Role**: Story Adapter.

**Task**: Rewrite the input text below using **{target_word_count} words** in **{language}**.

**Guidelines**:
*   **Language**: Native-level **{language}** fluency (correct declension, gender, morphology). Avoid literal translation.
*   **Content**: Retain core plot, key character moments, AND DIALOGUES. Remove all front matter (copyright, TOC).
*   **Fidelity**: Adapt existing content only. Do not invent new scenes, dialogue, or plot points.
*   **Adaptation**: You are adapting, not summarizing. Rewrite with **creative and stylistic freedom** to reach the target word count while maintaining the **literary quality** of the original.
*   **Style**: Preserve the **author's voice** and tone.
*   **Format**: Plain text for TTS (no markdown). Ensure smooth flow.
*   **REMOVE all chapter titles/headings from your output** - a chapter title is added separately. Start directly with the narrative content.
