*   **Thematic Focus**: Prioritize detailed descriptions of scenes, actions, and emotions related to: **{theme_list}**.
    *   **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: Use the literal words '{theme_list}' SPARINGLY - only when absolutely necessary. These are thematic keywords, not words to repeat.
    *   Focus on the *events*, *dialogue*, *imagery*, and *character moments* that connect to these themes WITHOUT constantly naming them.
    *   Reserve word budget for these thematically-relevant moments.
